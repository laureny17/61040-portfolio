# Assignment 1

## Domains

1. Productivity: Many people seek improvements in the way they study, organize their lives, etc.
2. Health: Mental and physical (exercise, sleep, diet)
3. Education: The content as well as the way in which people learn (not just children)
4. Social and community: Finding new ways (or revamping old ways) for people to connect with new people and solve problems hindering people's ability to maintain existing close relationships
5. Everyday tools: Creating tools to help out with small everyday tasks or add a little fun into everyday life
6. Artist tools: Creating tools to make it easier for less tech-savvy artists to organize projects, designs, and other important infortmation.
7. Campus resources: Improve and centralize the way schools store, display, and deliver information important to students
8. Event organization: Help organizers manage logistics for large-scale events
9. Entertainment: Explore how people can make use of their free time to relax through activities that they enjoy
10. Personal finance: Making aspects of finance more accessible and transparent to the average person

<!-- Problems -->

### Artist tools

1. _Artists often don't have a centralized system with which they can display information about themselves, their original characters, and commission statuses._ I didn't choose this because I think artists tend to be quite fond of their existing platforms. I think it'd be especially difficult to get artists to migrate all of their data on/art of their original characters to a new website/database.

2. _Artists often spend a lot of time finding references for their works._ I didn’t choose this because the logistics of finding a way to generate/automatically find pose/scene/etc. references for artists seems like it could take a lot of overhead, and artists tend to be pretty attached to using Pinterest, which is already a pretty well-functioning tool for references.

3. **Creative Collaboration for Kids: As a kid deeply involved in making high-committment art projects (animations) with medium to large groups, I found that it was always tough to make things work logistically and ensure that everything gets done due to decentralized communication. I think that Discord could work for this, but ideally there would be an app that is designed and developed solely for this purpose, instead of using a platform originally designed for casual and playful communication.** I chose this because this problem personally mattered a lot to me growing up, and I believe that a very important part of creating a project is having a complete understanding of the community for which the project is mainly being made for.

### Social and Community

1. _For people with less reach/social presence, it may be difficult to find reliable collaborators online._ I didn't choose this because it's too difficult to solve this issue when it would require either a huge user base or massive-scale, infeasible data scraping that could also frighten people who are found through the service (data privacy).

2. _Coordinating schedules with family and friends is often cumbersome, especially across different time zones and varying levels of busyness._ I think that if people are indifferent enough to not go out of their way to schedule meet-ups, then they probably wouldn't go out of their way to use this tool to automate schedule-coordinating anyways.

3. **Staying Updated: It’s hard to share life updates with close friends and family in a way that feels both meaningful and manageable. Group chats can get noisy or can feel less serious or intimate, social media feels performative, and one-on-one check-ins can be draining to do for everyone if you’re busy. A tool that focuses on more lightweight updates could help people feel present in each other’s lives without requiring too much effort during busy times.** I chose this problem because many of my friends have talked about how it's tough to keep in touch with people outside of their closest circle; some of my friends choose to post to their Instagram "close friends" stories, but a number of my other friends find Instgram (and other large social networks) as a platform to be too distracting to keep downloaded in the first place. I think it'd be helpful to have an app that is dedicated solely to the purpose of updating and staying updated with friends.

### Event Organization

_For reference, I'm a part of a hackathon organizing team that uses its own student-built projects along with Google Sheets for all of its logistics and tech._

1. _Application reading webapp has clunky UI that is hard to both understand and read, and I think a portion of the process can be automated through AI (while still having everything read by humans)._ I think that this is not too hard of a fix / not too much of a departure from the system we currently use; it's mostly the UI that is an issue, so we don't necessarily need a full over-haul.

2. _For volunteer coordination, much of the process (communication, signups, questions/requests for help) can be automated._ I think there often isn't as much information that needs to be recorded for volunteers, so perhaps most organizations are already satified with whatever system they currently have in place and would be unwilling to switch to something new that they're less familiar with.

3. **Coordinating Complex Event Schedules: As an event organizer, it's hard to keep track of multiple events happening at the same time when we need to list out a lot of information for each event (name, location, time, person in change, people helping out, etc.) and much of the information is dynamic/subject to change due to people moving around, things getting delayed, etc. Additionally, when many things are happening at once, it's too messy to use a tool like Google Calendar, but also can be visually overwhelming and confusing if put on a spredsheet instead, as we do currently. This means that each person must constantly check the spreadsheet constantly throughout the event days.** I chose this problem because how smoothly our event runs on the day-of is very important to me. I think it'd really help our small community to have a unified platform that keeps us all updated on what is going on and what has changed, as our currently system of using Google Sheets does the bare minimum and can be hard to read and understand, especially for newly-recruited organizers.

## Creative Collaboration for Kids

_As a kid deeply involved in making high-committment art projects (animations) with medium to large groups, I found that it was always tough to make things work logistically and ensure that everything gets done due to decentralized communication. I think that Discord could work for this, but ideally there would be an app that is designed and developed solely for this purpose, instead of using a platform originally designed for casual and playful communication._

### Stakeholders

1. Young creators: kids/teens making animations, comics, or other creative group projects online. They would be affected because this platform would be made for them to use.
2. Parents/Guardians: take care of the kids using the platform. They would be affected because they would be oncerned with their kids' online safety as well as their screen time and outside-of-school commitments.
3. Moderators (if any): project leaders or hired adults in charge of ensuring online safety, depending on implementation. They would be affected because they would have to go through and maintain the peace of the community/group.

### Evidence

1. [Self-organized communities for youth online creative production](https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/NSF/CDI/ICCE-kafai-1.pdf) provide a solid foundation for social skills needed in the future as adults.
2. [Coordination costs](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/design/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/challenges.html) can significantly delay project progress.
3. [Users have said that Discord is good for small-scale collaboration](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1at75cn/using_discord_to_collaborate_and_develop/), but not necessarily for larger projects. Discord threads are hard to work with.
4. For reasons such as privacy, security, and possible deletion of files, [Discord is not an ideal space for file storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIaECsmVqLw&t=2s).
5. [Discord has file attachment size limits](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/25444343291031-File-Attachments-FAQ).

### Features

1. Adding collaborators: Have a way for users to invite their collaborators to join the space, with verification so that strangers can't automatically join.
2. Draft sharing: An intuitive and engaging way for users to share their progress and request/receive feedback from others, perhaps with fun reaction stickers or other ways to make encouraging each other more fun and rewarding.
3. Project main page: Has an overview of the project, how far along the users are, what has been done and what hasn't, and perhaps an automatically put-together video/picture/text/etc. of all drafts in whatever stages they're currently in.

## Staying Updated

_It’s hard to share life updates with close friends and family in a way that feels both meaningful and manageable. Group chats can get noisy or can feel less serious or intimate, social media feels performative, and one-on-one check-ins can be draining to do for everyone if you’re busy. A tool that focuses on more lightweight updates could help people feel present in each other’s lives without requiring too much effort during busy times._

### Stakeholders

1. Busy people: People who don't have time to share life updated with everyone they want to keep in touch with. Important because this is the intended audience.
2. Less busy people: People who do have time to share life updates with everyone they want to keep in touch with. Important because: would people who actually have time to check in with many of their friends frequently still use this platform?
3. Core circle of user: The people the user wants to keep up with. Important because if the format of what information is shared and how is not up to their standards/they don't find it helpful or fun, they may quit using it or not use it in the first place.
4. Less close friends/acquaintances: People who may be friendly with the user but not close enough to be connected on this platform. Relevant beacuse visibility of user's presence and other connections may lead to these less close friends questioning their relationship.

### Evidence

1. It may be good to have a separate platform for just this purpose outside of the usual social networks such as Instagram, as these platforms [tend to be addictive](https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/your-health/living-well/the-addictiveness-of-social-media-how-teens-get-hooked).
2. An additional downside of more generalized social networking platforms such as Instagram is that [it could instead harm relationships and create more distance](https://ultrawinning.medium.com/people-say-they-use-social-media-to-stay-in-touch-with-friends-family-i-call-bullshit-4e1f954341dc).
3. [People are attracted to more authentic social media experiences](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/02/1102728947/why-teens-are-choosing-the-app-bereal-over-instagram).
4. Many people create ["fake" accounts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015323000776) limited to a smaller group of friends due to discomfort with posting to a larger adueience

### Features

1. Daily Digest/Summary: Since the platform is intended to help busy people, checking this platform itself may still be difficult, and they might miss some updates. It might help to consolidate information into one quick and easy-to-view summary.
2. Reminders of Inactivity in Relationships: Send a gentle reminder to a user if they haven't interacted (like, comment, etc.) with a friend's update in a while (a month, maybe).
3. Sharing Random Moments: Inspired by Bereal, perhaps a user could send out notifications to some or all of their circle that encourages their friends to share what they're currently doing.

## Coordinating Complex Event Schedules

_As an event organizer, it's hard to keep track of multiple events happening at the same time when we need to list out a lot of information for each event (name, location, time, person in change, people helping out, etc.) and much of the information is dynamic/subject to change due to people moving around, things getting delayed, etc. Additionally, when many things are happening at once, it's too messy to use a tool like Google Calendar, but also can be visually overwhelming and confusing if put on a spredsheet instead, as we do currently. This means that each person must constantly check the spreadsheet constantly throughout the event days._

### Stakeholders

1. Organizers in charge of logistics: The people behind scheduling and editing events. Important because they need a means through which they can easily and intuitively access controls to add and edit events in real-time during a hectic event day.
2. Other organizers: People in the organizing team but less involved in the logistics. Important because they know less about the schedule than those in charge of logistics, so it needs to be very clear to them what they need to do at what time and where.
3. Event participants: The people attending the event being organized. Important because how the event schedule is organized heavily impacts their experience.

### Evidence

1. Google Sheets is limited in functionality for event planning due to being built for [general purpose data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Sheets) over the specific purpose of event planning.

### Features

1. Spreadsheet Import: A way to import spreadsheet data into the website so that the basic information can be compiled and imported quickly.
2. Synced Overall and Personal Calendars: A button that automatically saves the events that organizers are signed up to help with to their own calendar, so they can view their personal schedule in isolation for easier readability. This calendar can be synced to the main calendar, so if changes are made or people get reassigned to different events, it's reflected in both calendars immediately.
3. Event Editing: A way for a select few organizers with authorization to easily go in and add, remove, and edit events whenever changes are made to the schedule.
